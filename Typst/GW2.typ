= How to speed up clears
We always try to kill bosses as fast as possible and speed up our clears as much as we can. \
In this sheet we go over multiple ways to speed up clears and I will do some recommendations.
Before we dive into the encounters themself we first go about some more general topics: \ \
- Increasing DPS \
  - Learning a Rotation \
  - Reducing encounters down to golems \
- Lower numbers of Healers \ 
- Getting the full view \ \

After this we go over the specific Wings and Encounters.

= Increasing DPS
Content: \
- Choosing the correct class \
- learning the Rotation \
- Adjusting your class for the encounter \ \ \

*Choosing the correct class* \
First you need a class suiting your play style, this is alway a very subjective choice:\
I personally love to play fast and always have something to click. I don't like long casts and love to have a lot of utility. So my preferred choices are the 3 light classes or Thief. \ \

You can sort the classes quite easily into some groups about speed and utility: \ \


*Attacking Speed* \
(Speed in this case means pure attacking speed as well as attacking frequency and is as such just my opinion) \ \ 
Slow: 
- Worrier \
- Power Guardian \ \

Mid:
- Ranger \
- Engineer \ 
- Necromancer \ 
- Power Revenant \ \

Fast: 
- Condition Guardian \
- Condition Revenant \
- Thief \
- Elementalist \
- Mesmer \ \

But this is just a basic behavior and of course does not apply to all Specs and Builds of a class. \

Of course there are basic recommendations for how hard a class is to master and play.
I personally do not like sorting classes like this, because this results more in
